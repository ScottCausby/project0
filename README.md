### Project 0 (tic tac toe)

- Renders a game board in the browser
- Switches turns between X and O
- Visually display which side won if a player gets three in a row or shows a draw

This game was created as my first ever project for General Assembly and is a working tic tac toe game.

The game lets 2 players vs eachother and reset the game at any time they please with the restart button.

I made this tic tac toe using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and JQuery.
